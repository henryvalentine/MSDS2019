#### Key Idea 8.8.1 gives the nth term of the Taylor series of common functins. In Exercises 3 â€“ 6, verify the formula given in the Key Idea by finding the first few terms of the Taylor series of the given function and identifying a pattern.

5.$f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x)}; c = 0$


```{r}
x = function(x) {1/(1-x)}

c = 0
n = 8

taylor(x, c, n)

```
