You have to actually pay attention and understand the message its trying to convey to the audience (us). Im glad it avoided all the typical Hollywood clichés. And the violence depicted in the film was very intense and had a purpose behind it. Josh Brolin steals the show here, his portrayal of Matt Graver was captivating; you will see far Matt Graver will go to complete mission. Del Toro gave a powerful performance as Alejandro as well. The ending is very bold but also very understanding when you consider the type of characters we are dealing with.',3),(2,'John rieber','2018-07-07 00:00:00',4.0,'This is a terrific followup to the first film, continuing to explore the drug and human trafficking at the border.

Evidently Lionsgate wants to treat their audience like suckers by taking their wallets for another spin on this franchise, but they won\'t be getting any of mine. Thanks to their little cliffhanger stunt, \'Sicario 3\' is getting the boycott treatment.',3),(4,'Ginak','2018-07-04 00:00:00',4.7,'I enjoyed Benicio Del Toro’s soulful performance most of all, but the rest of the cast was also very strong. I was a bit bored during the setup at the beginning, and towards the end I was ready to scream every time the “here comes something dramatic” musical theme was pounded out ad nauseum. But generally, this was an entertaining film with strong performances that kept me interested, and the charisma of Isabela Moner as Isabela Reyes (the drug lord’s kidnapped daughter) made up a bit for the absence of Emily Blunt. If your other option is being outside on a miserably hot and humid summer day and you are not into “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”, this is a good choice.',3),(5,'Kirollos-Noah','2018-11-29 00:00:00',4.0,'Sicario: Day of the Soldado is directed by Stefano Sollima, written by Taylor Sheridan, starring Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Isabela Moner.\n\nIn Sicario: Day of the Soldado, the series begins a new chapter. In the drug war, there are no rules--and as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists across the US border, federal agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) calls on the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose family was murdered by a cartel kingpin, to escalate the war in nefarious ways. Alejandro kidnaps the kingpin\'s daughter to inflame the conflict--but when the girl is seen as collateral damage, her fate will come between the two men as they question everything they are fighting for.\n\nThe sequel of Sicario offers the same dark theme of the first one, and here\'s the first flaw of this movie, it offers the same dark theme, with no hopeful scenes, just like the first one.. of course the story is changed, but for me, they just thought that the first did a great job with critics, audience and in the box office.\n\nNothing new or more than the first one as the performance of Benicio Del Toro.. Josh Brolin did a little pit more than the first one. Isabela Moner is bad, just like every movie she did, she was like reading the script during acting!\n\nThe story was great, but it\'s like some young assassins, getting trained in this movie. The movie sometimes felt like.. the creators trying to make more money of this sequel.\n\nAlso, some scenes were super-unnecessary, I think they did that to make the movie longer! I don\'t want to spoil anything to you, in case you didn\'t watch it. So for me, the movie was good, but it can\'t help, it\'s unnecessary.\n\nIt\'s not bad, but it\'s a let down to the fans of the first one.\nI\'m gonna give Sicario: Day of the Soldado a B.\n\nAlright, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.',3),(6,'Greg','2018-07-08 00:00:00',4.0,'Well, color me completely and utterly shocked. This is a sequel that\'s actually better than it\'s predecessor -- a movie directed by one of my favorite directors working, I might add. Things are just so much more tighter now. There\'s no dead weight in the form of a protagonist that\'s relegated to just spectatorship (like Blunt\'s character from the first one). There\'s a clear and understandable goal this time around that everyone being can identify with. And the action and set pieces are more spread out throughout each act. I don\'t know what else to say, I simply enjoyed this movie more than the first',3),(7,'John Rieber','2018-04-16 00:00:00',5.0,'This was exactly what I wanted and more. It\'s flawed, but the setting of the movie and stellar performances from Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan make up for it.

Yet again another incredible experience in cinemas.',6),(8,'Carlos Haz','2018-02-18 00:00:00',4.0,'It\'s pretty great!! The first 2 acts of this film are just amazing great. Learning more about Wakanda, and following the politics and learning more about just the whole culture of the land. I loved it. Also the actors/actress in this film where all giving such amazing performances. Particularly Michael B Jordan\'s villain. Easily one of the best Marvel villains. ...The biggest issue with the film. Sadly being something that does still get stuck in the stereotypical traits of most Marvel Flicks. I wanted more culture, politics and internal conflict, almost espionage like thrills. Not intense over-the-top explosion battles. Also the cgi is really crap at a few moments',6),(9,'Metaflix','2018-02-16 00:00:00',5.0,'There are no words to describe how much I loved this movie. Turns out the combination of the mastermind Kevin Feige with the talented writer/director Ryan Coogler has resulted in not just yet another widely entertaining addition to the MCU, but probably the best one yet. It has the same amount of depth as some of the franchise\'s best (Winter Soldier and Civil War), while the way the action sequences are shot and edited is absolutely sensetional. The cast is perfect and the visuals are simply beautiful - as is the soundtrack. This is a quite marvelous movie that will just raise your hype for \'Infinity War\' and what\'s about to come.',6),(10,'Greg','2018-03-22 00:00:00',5.0,'Its not a bad movie, but its not mind blowing either! Another forgettable marvel movie with a script put together by a computer algorithm that basically collects data on what a majority audience liked on Facebook and other people who feed data to the NSA. The villain is relatable though, actually hes the first villain that you actually relate to [in a way where you try to teach your racist grandpa[Black panther guy] about smartphones and he says we\'re all going to hell for inventing that]',6),(11,'Ginak','2018-11-26 00:00:00',3.6,'Without giving anything away I would say there are entertaining action sequences, a look into a futuristic Africa which is cool, but the movie lacks a massive amount of character development. You don\'t feel invested in the protagonist at all- even by the end of the movie. I swear Disney pays off reviewers because I expected a movie closer to a 90% based on the reviews I read. It was entertaining visually and a nice escape but overall nothing really stuck with me.',6),(12,'Krollos-Noah','2018-07-26 00:00:00',4.0,'I Left work early to see the it opening day and was a bit disappointed. I was hopping for something great like last years Logan or Wonder Woman. Instead I watch some long drawn out boring movie. Honestly, I could not stay tuned to the movie. I am sure it will make money but believe this is no Logan or other great SH type movie that we all hope it would be. It just goes to show you that you can not trust what the critic are saying in their reviews.',6),(13,'John Rieber','2019-02-02 00:00:00',5.0,'The Movie is amazing, so emotional, acting is brilliant, just such a great follow up to the original.',1),(14,'Carlos Haz','2019-02-03 00:00:00',4.8,'I love all of the Rocky movies (except Rocky 5), so I was very excited to see Creed II. Although Creed II utilizes the basic formula and structure of a Rocky movie, it works, because it\'s gotten me to the theater to see an eighth Rocky movie. The performances from the cast are amazing, especially from Michael B. Jordan, and the movie does a great job fleshing out the extremely cheesy Russian villains from Rocky 4. It\'s not as groundbreaking as the first Creed movie, but the themes and fight sequences are great enough for me to walk out of the theater wanting to see more Creed. Overall, go see it if you like Rocky movies',1),(15,'Metaflix','2019-02-05 00:00:00',4.7,'A sports movie sequel done right, \'Creed II\' takes everything that worked so well in \'Creed\' and augments it to a satisfying degree without entering the realms of silliness that some of the other \'Rocky\' films unfortunately wandered into. The stakes, the circumstances, the character arcs, the time span -- all of it is heightened, making for a fantastically enthralling and invigorating movie-going experience. And with a really nuanced look into the lives and motivations of the antagonistic forces at hand in the film, it all ultimately shapes out to being more than just your average \'good-fighter-versus-evil-fighter\' slugfest. This is a much needed, crowd-pleasing effort with some terrific performances, an epic feel, and a commanding mainstream directorial debut from one Steven Caple Jr. Color this opinion unpopular, but I might just like this one more than the first.',1),(16,'Greg','2019-02-02 00:00:00',4.6,'A real great movie and with a great message, in perfect line with the first installment, i hope in a third movie.',1),(17,'Ginak','2019-02-06 00:00:00',3.9,'Solid and sober. Elements that were always needed in the Rocky sequels, however my biggest fear became reality because the film is completely structured as all those Rocky sequels and it feels so predictable that it takes away much of the charm.\n\nIt\'s still a very entertaining film and a remarkable sequel. I definitely recommend it. But you should see it with the mentality that this film is completely devoid of surprises and while it doesn\'t disappoint, it\'s not memorable or worthy of more attention.\n\nAlso they must definitely stop here. A third film would only commit the same mistakes. And it will definitely not feel so fresh anymore',1),(18,'Krollos-Noah','2019-02-05 00:00:00',4.2,'I love the first \'Creed\', it was one of my top films of 2015. This has a much more committed and emotional Michael B. Jordan and some of the energy that made the first film so great, but in between is filler, predictability and a more workmanlike execution.',1),(19,'John Rieber','2019-02-02 00:00:00',5.0,'I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is genuinely a revelation and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI sense but also capture every last detail of Brolin\'s performance. I was completely engrossed for the entire movie. The Russo\'s wield their own Infinity Gauntlet over the Marvel Universe with absolute control. My only reservation is whether the consequences will stick in the next part; I hope they remain brave and leave some in place. Superb!',4),(20,'Carlos Haz','2019-02-03 00:00:00',5.0,'Almost the PERFECT superhero movie. So good, plot twists, action, everything! Worst thing I can say is they did cram a lot into it, so at times feels rushed.

The only negatives are that the movie felt a little bit too predictable and some parts in the middle made me lose my interest at times.',4),(23,'Ginak','2019-02-06 00:00:00',4.9,'This review contains spoilers. The Marvel Cinematic Universe recently hit the ten year milestone and for those that have not followed the popular franchise, Avengers: Infinity War marks the first time that a number of the popular characters have appeared on screen together to battle the lingering threat of Thanos. This alone makes the film worth seeing, as almost every single major character makes an appearance.',4),(24,'Krollos-Noah','2019-02-05 00:00:00',5.0,'The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie.',4),(25,'Carlos Haz','2019-02-02 00:00:00',5.0,'\'Another Spider-Man movie,\' you ask? Get excited as \'Spider-Verse\' breathes new life into our familiar friendly neighborhood hero. It is slickly and gorgeously animated in a way I have never seen Western cinema attempt before. This is the closest we will get to a comic book coming to life.\n\nFor a movie jam-packed with main characters, they find a fun and extremely efficient way to introduce them all without getting too repetitive or too dumbed-down. Minimal expositional dialogue gives way to creative visual devices and recalls that are implemented so satisfyingly because they treat the audience like the smart people that we are.\n\nIf you are looking for humor (meta or slapstick), lessons on power and responsibility, shocking twists (for non-comic book readers), meaningful cameos, tear-jerking emotional scenes, action-packed sequences, then you are ready to swing into this universe. I, for one, am sucked into this Spider-Verse. And I don\'t want out. ',5),(26,'John Rieber','2019-02-03 00:00:00',5.0,'That is a great movie!!!

There was also an excellent music soundtrack that accompanied every scene of the movie, and I appreciated the hip hop influences on the music and the characters. The story was fun, although I thought that some of the characters were a bit superfluous. It also followed many of the superhero origin tropes, which I wasn\'t expecting based on some of the reviews calling this \'like nothing you\'ve seen before\'. Overall, very enjoyable and I look forward to a sequel.',5),(28,'Greg','2019-02-02 00:00:00',4.7,'While some of the coincidental plot points in the movie were annoying,overall the movie not only had probably the best also animation style I\'ve seen all year, but also maintained surprisingly developed characters and jokes.

This was the perfect way for Knight to test the waters and sample this new look and feel to transformers and leaves all doors open for however they would wish to continue this series. It was a more personal story than any of the other movies in the series, but doesn\'t tie itself down with that. These producers and writers could even take the franchise in a more Marvel direction and make more films centered around one character, and bring them together in a major film, and based on the way that this film was presented, that style of presentation could really work for this franchise. Overall, Bumblebee does everything that this series needed and tells a more down to earth story, while still carrying the epic proportions that Transformers always has. This may not be the most epic film in the series, but it is definitely the best and if they continue to run the series like this, Transformers fans have a lot of great films to look forward to.',2),(33,'Metaflix','2019-02-05 00:00:00',4.9,'Definitely should be the start of a reboot. Bumblebee feels like the first movie meets the Iron Giant. It has more of a brain though. Than the first movie. Especially more than Michael Bay’s loud, long and brainless sequels. It feels more like Transformers. Some might just not approve that it’s a cute and heart warming Transformers movie. While Cena’s acting is like he’s doing a segment in WWE. Hailee Steinfeld and Bee own the movie. The Cena scenes are not really the strong points. When it cuts back to Steinfeld.

And it\'s not that it was a great film but it was fun and entertaining although hardly memorable.\n\nSurprisingly the franchise decided to look back with a prequel, they also got rid of Michael Bay and his overloaded style and they actually gave more substance to a story that had missed its mark and guidence in recent years.\n\nBumblebee, it turns out it\'s truly the best film of the franchise but only because the quality that it had to overcome wasn\'t so high in the first place.\nHowever that doesn\'t mean that I\'m minimizing its achievements, I\'m just simply putting them in perspective.\n\nIt\'s a fun flick but I did hate Hailee Steinfeld\'s intervention since her character is simply an emotional anchor and the truth is that the story of the robots is 100% more interesting than hers.\n\nBeyond that and although I wasn\'t expect anything from it, Bumblebee is a pleasant surprise and a good option for this end of the year.',2),(35,'Ginak','2019-02-06 00:00:00',5.0,'Reminds us that yellow cars are the best cars, and that 80s music is the best music.
